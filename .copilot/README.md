# GitHub Copilot Configuration for Space Data Communication Project

This directory contains configuration files and instructions for optimizing GitHub Copilot's performance within the Space Data Communication Analysis Project.

## Project Context for Copilot

### Domain Expertise
This project focuses on:
- **Space Communication Systems**: Satellite communication protocols and standards
- **NASA Standards Compliance**: CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) protocols
- **Real-Time Systems**: High-frequency message processing (1000Hz for critical telemetry)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Error correction, redundancy, and graceful degradation
- **Security**: Post-quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution
- **Performance**: Low-latency communication for space applications

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.10+**: Primary development language
- **Asyncio**: Asynchronous programming for real-time performance
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Scientific computing for signal analysis
- **Cryptography Libraries**: For security implementations
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment
- **Pytest**: Testing framework

### Coding Standards
- **NASA Coding Standards**: Space application requirements
- **PEP 8**: Python style guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Required for all function signatures
- **95%+ Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing requirements
- **Docstring Standards**: Google-style documentation

## Copilot Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices for This Project

1. **Context-Aware Prompting**
   ```python
   # Good: Provides context about space communication requirements
   # "Create a priority-based message scheduler for NASA CCSDS-compliant
   # satellite communication with 1000Hz processing capability"

   # Bad: Too generic
   # "Create a message queue"
   ```

2. **NASA Standards Integration**
   - Always mention CCSDS compliance when working with communication protocols
   - Reference NASA requirements documentation format
   - Include fault tolerance and error handling considerations

3. **Performance-Critical Code**
   - Specify latency requirements (<50ms for real-time, <1ms for critical)
   - Include memory management considerations
   - Mention thread-safety and async requirements

### Project-Specific Prompts

#### For Message Scheduling
```
"Create a Python class for priority-based message scheduling in a space
communication system. It should support high (1000Hz), medium (500Hz),
and low (100Hz) priority messages according to NASA CCSDS standards.
Include proper error handling and type hints."
```

#### For Error Correction
```
"Implement LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) error correction for satellite
communication data packets. The implementation should handle up to 50%
packet loss and be compliant with NASA fault tolerance requirements."
```

#### For Security Features
```
"Create a post-quantum cryptography implementation for space communication
security. Include lattice-based encryption algorithms suitable for
long-term space missions and quantum-safe key exchange protocols."
```

#### For Testing
```
"Write comprehensive pytest test cases for [component] including unit tests,
integration tests, and performance benchmarks. Include NASA standards
compliance verification and fault tolerance scenario testing."
```

### Code Generation Guidelines

When using Copilot for this project:

1. **Always Include**:
   - Type hints for all parameters and return values
   - Comprehensive docstrings with NASA compliance notes
   - Error handling with proper logging
   - Performance considerations for space applications

2. **Never Generate**:
   - Hardcoded credentials or secrets
   - Code that doesn't handle edge cases
   - Functions without proper error handling
   - Code that violates NASA security standards

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - Memory allocation patterns for long-running space missions
   - Graceful degradation under off-nominal conditions
   - Real-time constraints and timing requirements
   - Fault tolerance and redundancy mechanisms

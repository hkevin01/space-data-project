## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Contact Information

For security-related issues, please do **NOT** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following channels:

- **Email**: Send details to [security@project-domain.com](mailto:security@project-domain.com)
- **Private Security Report**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **GPG Encrypted Email**: For highly sensitive issues, use our GPG key (available on request)

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Assessment of the potential impact
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
5. **Proposed Solution**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
6. **Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receiving the report
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours, we will assess the severity and impact
- **Resolution Timeline**:
  - Critical vulnerabilities: 7 days
  - High severity: 14 days
  - Medium severity: 30 days
  - Low severity: 90 days

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. **Private Resolution**: We work with reporters to fix issues privately
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fixes are available
3. **Credit**: Security researchers are credited for their discoveries (unless they prefer anonymity)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **Encryption**: Post-quantum cryptography for all sensitive communications
- **Authentication**: Mutual TLS for all network communications
- **Integrity**: HMAC verification for all messages
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for system components
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Intrusion Detection**: AI-based anomaly detection for network traffic

### Secure Development Practices

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require security-focused reviews
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit and CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned with Trivy
- **Secrets Management**: No secrets stored in code or configuration files

### NASA Security Compliance

This project follows NASA security standards for space applications:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of appropriate controls
- **NASA Security Requirements**: Compliance with NASA-STD-1006 and related standards
- **CCSDS Security Standards**: Implementation of space communication security protocols
- **FIPS 140-2**: Use of validated cryptographic modules where required

## Known Security Considerations

### Space Communication Specific Risks

1. **Signal Interception**: All communications are encrypted with post-quantum algorithms
2. **Jamming/Interference**: Fault tolerance mechanisms provide redundant communication paths
3. **Replay Attacks**: Nonce-based encryption prevents message replay
4. **Man-in-the-Middle**: Mutual authentication prevents unauthorized intermediaries

### General Application Security

1. **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries prevent injection attacks
3. **Cross-Site Scripting**: Output encoding prevents XSS in web interfaces
4. **Buffer Overflows**: Memory-safe languages and practices prevent overflows

## Security Updates

### Automatic Updates

- **Dependency Updates**: Automated weekly scanning and updates for security patches
- **Container Updates**: Base images updated regularly for security fixes

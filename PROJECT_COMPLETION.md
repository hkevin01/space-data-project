async fn critical_message_processor() {
    loop {
        // Process critical messages at 1000Hz
        Timer::after(Duration::from_millis(1)).await;
        watchdog::reset();
    }
}
```

### Multi-Band Communication System
```rust
pub fn select_optimal_band(&self, message: &Message) -> BandType {
    match message.priority {
        MessagePriority::Emergency => BandType::UhfBand,  // Most reliable
        MessagePriority::Critical => BandType::SBand,    // Fast and reliable
        MessagePriority::High => BandType::XBand,        // Good balance
        MessagePriority::Medium => BandType::KBand,      // High speed
        MessagePriority::Low => BandType::KaBand,        // Highest speed
    }
}
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
```rust
pub enum RecoveryAction {
    None,
    RestartComponent(String<32>),
    SwitchToBackup(String<32>),
    PowerCycle(String<32>),
    SafeMode,
    EmergencyShutdown,
}
```
